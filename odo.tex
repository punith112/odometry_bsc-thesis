\section{Introduction}


\subsection{RoboCup}

The RoboCup is an international research and education initiative. 
It's goal is ``By the year 2050, develop a team of fully autonomous robots that can win against the current human soccer world champion team"~\cite{robocup.org}.
It encourages research in the field of robotics, e.g. machine vision, machine learning, autonomous systems.

%|| to Apollo Program.

Every year, a world championship is held accomplished by a conference in a different city around the globe.
Also, various local competitions and conferences are held by local groups.

The RoboCup is divided into three parts: RoboCup Soccer, Rescue and @Home.
Every division is divided into several leagues targetet at different challenges.

\subsection{\MSL}

In RoboCup Soccer, the \MSL is the most challenging.
The robots have to be fully autonomous.
All sensors, actuators and computation are on board, no external input is allowed.
A Team consists of at most 6~robots with a size of max. $50\times50\times80$\,cm$^3$.

The game is played on a field of $12\times18$\,m$^2$ and lasts $2\times15$~minutes.
The \MSL is the only league, where an official FIFA ball is used.
Objects are distinguished by color, the game field is green with white lines, robots and referees are black and the ball is red.

The rules are official FIFA rules~\cite{msl-rules} with slight adaptions for robotic players.
The game rules are tightened every year to keep up with the technological progress. 
E.g. the field size has grown from $6\times8$\,m$^2$ to $12\times18$\,m$^2$ since introduction of the \MSL.

More than 20 teams from all over the world participate in the \MSL, almost all with academical background.

\subsection{\MH}

The \MH participates in the \MSL. 
It's name is a reference to the ``Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' by Douglas Adams~\cite{h2g2}.
It was founded 2003 at Graz University of Technology at the Institute for Software Technology. 
It consists solely of students and acts as a platform for master's, bachelor's thesis and seminar projects.
Currently, more than 30~students are working on the robots in their free time.

It regularily participates at european championships as well as World Championships.
RoboCup 2009 in Graz was the first time the team advanced a round in a World Championship. 
Also, the third place in the technical challenge was won.

\subsection{Current Robot Platform: Krikkit}

The ``Krikkit'' robot platform was built in 2006~\cite{}. 
It was designed solely for playing soccer, in contrast to the old, multi-purpose research robot platform.
Nearly all components, from electronics to mechanical parts are develeped in-house.
Four robots were built and made their debut at the World Championship 2006 in Bremen.

Some of the main features of the ``Krikkit'' robot are shown in \autoref{fig:krikkit}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{figures/krikkit}
\caption{\label{fig:krikkit}

}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

It has a $360^\circ$ omnidirectonal vision system via a firewire-camera pointing upwards to a hyperbolic mirror.\\
Its brain is a standard mini-ITX industrial PC.\\
A powerful pneumatic kicker with a~200\,bar pressurised air bottle as supply enables the robot to kick the ball approx. 10\,m forward.\\
Its drive system is also omnidirectional and is based on self-designed Mecanum wheels~\cite{mecanum2007}. 
The $45^\circ$-Arrangement of the wheels (see~\autoref{fig:mec-wheel}) promised smooth and vibration-free operation.
The three wheels are arranged in $120^\circ$-steps and are driven by a 200\,W brushless DC motor for each axis. 
Due to the nature of omni-wheels, the robots are able to move in any direction and any orientation.\\
The motors and all other electric components are supplied by a smart battery system~\cite{krammer06}.
All electronic components are connected via CAN-Bus.

\end{center}
\end{figure}


The Krikkit robots served well for four years, much was learned.
Before RoboCup~2009 in Graz, a major mechanics overhaul was done.
In the meantime, all major electronic components also reached the end of their life cycle.
With the knowledge gained, lost and aquired again the successor of the Krikkit generation is in development now.
    

\subsection{In Development: Krikkit3G}

The next generation of robots is in development since mid-2010.
It will be a direct successor of the Krikkit generation, therefor the name \emph{Krikkit3G}.
The successful concepts are are adopted nearly unchanged:

\begin{itemize}
  \item omnidrive with the three Mecanum Wheels
  \item the omni-vision system
  \item pneumatic kicking concept
  \item the use of a standard mini-ITX industrial PC
  \item modularity of all components
\end{itemize}

The new robot design focuses on the strict modularity of all components.
It has been shown that fast disassembling and replacing of critical components is crucial in the fast-paced tournament environment.
Especially the power train has been modularized, the wheel, gearing, motor and motor electronics can be swapped as a whole group.

For the kicking system, the pneumatic principle was kept.
But it is now much more versatile. 
It can switch between high and flat kicks at full power, and side-kicks are also possible now.
It features a new ball guidance system, which allows grabbing the ball for a short moment.
This becomes especially useful when decelerating.

Big changes were made in the electronics sector.
A new microcontroller core (An ARM Cortex M3) is used on every component, replacing the different types used before.
The smart battery system also got a major upgrade, featuring even smarter batteries.

In the mechanical design, space is now also provied for an improved odometry system, which will be develeped based on this work.
